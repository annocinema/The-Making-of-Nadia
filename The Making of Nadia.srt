00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,840
Hello, everyone!

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Nadia.

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,050
I'm Nadia's friend, Jean.

5
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,680
I'm their cupid that'll
bring them together, Marie!

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,050
Marie!

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,390
But it's true!

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,470
Am I wrong?

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,060
In your eyes I see a bright future

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,230
Blue Water by Miho Morikawa
In your eyes I see a bright future

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,980
In your eyes I see a bright future

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,950
Lighting up everything

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Thank you for always supporting
Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,330
Today we have an
exclusive video just for you.

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,330
We'll show you
the seven songs of Nadia

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,010
as well as a scene not yet broadcasted!

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,350
I think you're going to get to know
Nadia's cast and staff really well.

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,680
Have fun and watch until the end!

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,890
As it starts to play

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,110
It lets out a bit of happiness and courage!

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,870
In your eyes I see a bright future

22
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,450
Words are an eternal signal

23
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,250
Don't forget to try in mind

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,630
More than jewels

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,640
Love lights up everything

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,010
Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water
Love lights up everything

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water

28
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,400
Hmmm?

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Where are we?

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,990
- There are a lot of people.
- Where indeed?

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,150
Ah!

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,700
This is the chief director that created our
story and prepared each scene! Anno!

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,040
Ah, all our suffering was Anno's doing!

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,330
But look, he's smiling.

35
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,130
Nadia, don't be fooled by his smile.

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,760
He's the kind of person that
will finish you off with a smile.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,380
Keep your guard up.

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,890
They go around and cut in twice.
It's just wrong.

39
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,930
No, it's fine.

41
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,690
Just where do director Anno's stories originate?

42
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,860
As one of his creations, I'm
especially interested in hearing it.

43
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,580
Alright! Let's take a peek
inside that brain of his!

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,790
The only way to move a
person's heart is through their soul.

45
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,790
It's a soul only they can posses.

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,470
You can't move people's
hearts with cheap tricks.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,390
A person's soul, just like this airplane,
takes its weapons and aims for the heart.

48
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,390
We the staff of Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water

49
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,360
have spent a year and a half
putting our soul into production.

50
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,530
As long as you understand that, I'll be happy.

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,960
Let's Go Jean! by Noriko Hidaka

52
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:00,010
Jean! Jean! Jean!

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,800
My name is

54
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,510
Jean Rocque Raltique

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,470
I'm the number one

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,190
Scientist in the world

57
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,810
Unlimited possibilities

58
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,570
Hiding in your tiny chest

59
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,240
Don't throw your dreams away

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,990
Keep your spirits up

61
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,660
Let's go!

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,870
To the ocean!

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,540
Let's go!

64
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
To the sky!

65
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:42,210
A brighter tomorrow spells out our future!

66
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,390
Go, go, go, go, let's go!

67
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,890
Go, go, go, go, fight go!

68
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:57,440
The dawn of science is approaching!

69
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Jean! Jean! Jean!

70
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,080
My name is

71
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,460
Jean Rocque Raltique

72
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,890
I'm a scientist of love and justice

73
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,180
A sharp intuition

74
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,020
Overflowing imagination

75
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,230
My theory is

76
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,730
Perfect!

77
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,610
Let's catch it!

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,360
That rainbow!

79
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,110
Let's catch it!

80
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,820
Our happiness!

81
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:58,210
The world is covered in a giant blanket of hope!

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,460
Go, go, go, go, guts go!

83
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,800
Go, go, go, go, dash go!

84
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:12,970
The dawn of science is approaching!

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,320
Let's go!

86
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,990
To the ocean!

87
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,570
Let's go!

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
To the sky!

89
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,540
Not by ourselves!

90
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,580
Everyone all together!

91
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,960
Go, go, go, go, let's go!

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,050
Go, go, go, go, fight go!

93
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:54,760
Humanity's awakening is approaching!

94
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,770
Jean! Jean! Jean!

95
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,280
I think I understand where Anno's
stories originate from a little better.

96
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,160
Yeah, he really admires science
and puts his imagination to the test!

97
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,000
But you know, drawing
and animating is hard work.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The three of us decided to
try our hand at animation.

99
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,130
Hello.

100
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,680
Excuse us.

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,260
Ah, it's so quiet.

102
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,510
Yeah.

103
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,060
This is where we can help make Nadia.

104
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,230
It's kind of...

105
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,690
It's a lot bigger than I thought.

106
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,020
Right? I didn't think it would be so spacious.

107
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,900
-Yeah
-Eh

108
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,700
I heard Anno is waking up from
a nap somewhere around here.

109
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,320
Here?

110
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,990
Really?

111
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,410
Does that mean there is a
resting room in this office?

112
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,410
Seems fun. Let's take a peek later.

113
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,080
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,290
The first step to animation is
you need to decide on a design.

115
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,590
For today, I've written that all here.

116
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,670
Read through it carefully and start working.

117
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,260
Ok.

118
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,470
Any questions?

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,470
Director.

120
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,010
Yes.

121
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,930
What is the most important
part of making animation?

122
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,600
Intuition.

123
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,260
Only your intuition?

124
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,970
Sense.

125
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,310
Only intuition and sense?

126
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,480
Also effort and willpower.

127
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,270
That makes sense!

128
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,020
It does.

129
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,860
I get it.

130
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,730
Let's try our best.

131
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,070
Please do.

132
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,650
Ok.

133
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,580
Doushite Sou Nano? by Yuko Mizutani

134
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:54,720
I guess you're al
fighting about messy, boring stuff

135
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,180
For being mature adults, you're all very rude

136
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,690
Why? How come it's like this?

137
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,570
All the glares and grumpy looks

138
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,990
Don't take it out on me, ok?

139
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,700
Let's go pick bouq
of red and white flowers instead!

140
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,120
Why? How come it's like this?

141
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:42,680
Come on, King, pay attention to my troubles!

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,060
1, 2, 3, I hate studying

143
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,150
A, B, C, I can't remember anything

144
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,410
1, 2, 3, I hate lectures too!

145
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,160
Why is it like this?

146
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,420
Why? How come it's like this?

147
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,790
Can we take a little break?

148
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,460
Snacks would be good.

149
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,210
I'm already tired.

150
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,550
Sorry. I haven't drawn much.

151
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,590
Why do you act like you're angry
Sorry. I haven't drawn much.

152
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,430
Why do you act like you're angry

153
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,760
It's all about your intuition.
Why do you act like you're angry

154
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,720
That's what he said earlier.

155
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
Saying no to this and no to that
That's what he said earlier.

156
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,480
Saying no to this and no to that

157
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,360
Why don't you pay more atten
to how blue the sky and sea are?

158
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,740
Why? How come it's like this?

159
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,620
Alright.

160
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,790
Perfect!

161
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,120
Ok, I'm not sure if it's perfect.

162
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,790
The more I look at it, the more I regret this.

163
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:55,790
Exhausted?

164
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm glad we were able to finish by today.

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,800
I thought we would run over into tomorrow.

166
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,470
- Yoshino.

167
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,930
- For now...yes?
- Yoshino.

168
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,390
- For now...yes?

169
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,430
We have to redraw them.

170
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,850
Finished?

171
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,940
Somehow.

172
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,230
It's perfect!

173
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,940
We're all beat!

174
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,980
We had to redraw them.

175
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,190
That's tough.

176
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,110
This is really grueling work.

177
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,690
Yeah.

178
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,320
Ah, don't look!

179
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,990
To ho ho.

180
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,030
To ho ho, really explains my feelings right now.

181
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,910
- Oh My God
To ho ho, really explains my feelings right now.

182
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,030
- Oh My God

183
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,620
Shall we take a look?

184
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,410
Hmmm, alright.

185
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,500
Alright.

186
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,500
I decided what cut I wanted to draw.

187
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,710
Awesome!

188
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,170
Already?!

189
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,590
It's already over?

190
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,050
Wow, wow, wow!

191
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,100
1, 2, 3, I hate lectures too!

192
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,980
Why is it like this?

193
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,780
Why? How come it's like this?

194
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,610
"I'm going to give it my all
again this year! - Mizutani Yuko"

195
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,040
"Everyone should be upfront with their
feelings, just like Jean - Hidaka Noriko"

196
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,080
"Nadia is only just starting. Thank you
and keep watching! - Takamori Yoshiko

197
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,080
How did you like seeing it all together?

198
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,880
When I look at it like this, I'm glad I did it.

199
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,500
- Same, seeing it all strung together I'm glad I did it.
When I look at it like this, I'm glad I did it.

200
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,840
- Same, seeing it all strung together I'm glad I did it.

201
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,800
- I guess I've gotten better.
- Same, seeing it all strung together I'm glad I did it.

202
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,420
- I guess I've gotten better.

203
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,760
We only drew ten frames,
but I already felt burnt out after five.

204
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,770
I mean, you have to keep
drawing the same image.

205
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,430
Thank you and good job.

206
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,520
Thank you very much!

207
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,020
Your art sure was something.

208
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm surprised that after all that hard work,
the final product was so short.

209
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,660
Yeah, I guess it's much better
if we stick to spreading love!

210
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,410
With that, we're going to show you
a recording at our recording studio.

211
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,880
Today we're actually
recording something!

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,710
Everyone is entering
one after another.

213
00:12:59,710 --> 00:12:59,960
- Good morning.
Everyone is entering
one after another.

214
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,590
- Good morning.

215
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,550
Good morning.

216
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,850
Good morning.

217
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,720
Have A Nice Day.

218
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,480
Good morning.

219
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,570
Ok, take a look at this cut.

220
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,150
Where it says, I'm the heir
of the kingdom of Tartessos...

221
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,740
They record with all of these
voice actors together in one room.

222
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,330
Yeah, AR or after recording
is the technical term.

223
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,290
In other words, after the animation
is done the lines are recorded.

224
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,290
Abbreviated it ends up as AR.

225
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,800
When you say the kingdom, I
want you to stress the "king".

226
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,170
- Ok.
When you say the kingdom, I
want you to stress the "king".

227
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,300
When you say the kingdom, I
want you to stress the "king".

228
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,840
- It's the last, so...

229
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,140
I think it was the first time I left early.

230
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,850
Really?

231
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,850
So you went first?

232
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,600
You actually came right at 10am.

233
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,350
You bet.

234
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,890
Got it.

235
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,150
Ok, let's start.

236
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,730
Things are finally starting.

237
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,700
Everyone looks like they're
on the edge of their seat.

238
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,370
Episode 35 - Secret of the Blue Water

239
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,910
Ai no Sannin Gumi by Kumiko Takizawa,
Henyu Horiguchi, Toshiharu Sakurai

240
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,850
Oh, are you in love with someone?

241
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,060
Oh, a love like fire!

242
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,740
Oh, leave your tears be
and set out on a journey

243
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,580
Come search for true love with us!

244
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,160
Even if it's to the ends of the universe

245
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,870
Don't worry.

246
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,710
I promised you.

247
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,130
I heard the sound of a bell...

248
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,930
This is bad, Jean! Run for it! Turn back!

249
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,760
- No, I can't let Nadia go alone!
This is bad, Jean! Run for it! Turn back!

250
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,510
- No, I can't let Nadia go alone!

251
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,300
Hey! Nadia!

252
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,640
Nadia!

253
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,720
You can't go in there!

254
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,560
What's wrong Nadia?!

255
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,100
Nadia!

256
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,520
Wait, Nadia!

257
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,440
Nadia!

258
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,950
Wow! Hey, hey! Nadia, let me try.

259
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,400
I can, can't I? Nadia!

260
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:32,780
Ok? Ok?

261
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,910
No!

262
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,280
All of the voice actors have
their own skills and techniques.

263
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,790
But, they sure have a strange
resemblance to their characters.

264
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,960
They say that when they're picking the voice actors
they choose people who are similar to the characters.

265
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,380
Hey, hey. I wonder how all
of them feel when recording?

266
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,840
I want to ask them!

267
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,430
I'm the voice of Electra, Inoue Kikuko.

268
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,220
Um...

269
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,770
I'm also the voice of the Nautilus's narration system.

270
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,150
As a character, I really feel that...

271
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:56,160
Hm....it's a waste to have her voiced by me.

272
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,700
I feel so fortunate to have this role.

273
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,120
The TV series will finish in March.

274
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:10,839
But I would be so excited to meet
all of you again in OVAs or movies.

275
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,719
Please continue to support us!

276
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,550
Hello.

277
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm the voice of Captain Nemo, Otsuka Akio.

278
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,140
Captain Nemo, at his core,
is a uncommunicative person.

279
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,770
He's the kind of guy
that only talks if he has to.

280
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,190
It was a slightly challenging role to play, but I'm fond of it.

281
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,150
Thank you to all the fans.

282
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,160
Continue to stick with us.

283
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,790
I'm the voice of Ayerton, Tsujitani Koji.

284
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,080
Um... Ayerton's role was...

285
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,670
How could I say this? He is all over the place.

286
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,250
Um...you know...

287
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,920
One minute he'd be bragging about himself
and the next he'd say something of substance.

288
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,010
He'd pretends to be everyone's friend
and then turn around and betray them.

289
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,220
Basically, it's the role of a troublemaker.

290
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,520
Being the comedic unknown combo rather than,
say, the comedic love interest was a first for me.

291
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:18,400
Once I got into it, though, I realized
it was actually an entertaining role.

292
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,620
For a count such as myself, these trivial
matters are of little concern to me.

293
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,460
However, today, for  the sake of
everyone else, I shall participate.

294
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,710
I look forward to your continued patronage.

295
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,170
Good Luck, Everyone!

296
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm Gargoyle's voice, Kiyokawa Motomu.

297
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:44,220
When I first got this role, I heard he was the villain.

298
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:54,610
Um...If this were a normal anime, the villain
would sound like a villain. I don't like that.

299
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:03,030
In the end, the villain dies not
knowing he was the villain.

300
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,240
If he does realize he's in
the wrong only at the end,

301
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,910
why not have him sound
like a good guy before?

302
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,420
No matter how bad the character is,
evil doesn't match my personality.

303
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:21,760
Whenever I have to voice a character like
that, I tend to give them a gentler voice.

304
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,720
It seems like Gargoyle reveals his face
in the end, so look forward to that.

305
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,020
Hello, everyone.

306
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,900
I'm the voice of Grandis Granva, Takizawa Kumiko.

307
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,490
It's already been 15 years since I
started working as a voice actress.

308
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,160
When I first started out, I was primarily
voicing little girls, around five years old.

309
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:52,670
Getting to voice a resolute gang leader character like Grandis has been incredibly fun.

310
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,710
I've been told our personalities are eerily
similar, but I didn't try to become her.

311
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,180
I worked very hard to make
her my very own character.

312
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,390
The staff didn't have many opportunities
to go out drinking, so it was little lonely.

313
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,560
I hope I can get together with
these members on the next project.

314
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,480
I don't know how many years later that
next project might be, but it would be nice.

315
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,900
I hope to keep taking on more roles,
so I look forward to your support.

316
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,940
See you.

317
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,280
I'm the voice of Hanson and King, Sakurai Toshiharu.

318
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,830
When you think about Hanson,
he looks like a bad guy.

319
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,290
Slowly but surely he became
a good kind of bad guy.

320
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,420
In a way, he warmed up to
Nadia and the rest of the group.

321
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,840
I feel like Hanson and I are similar.

322
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,560
It was a simple role to
understand and perform.

323
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:56,020
If you see me, I mean if you hear my
voice as Hanson or King, or any other role

324
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:03,780
I hope you'll store it in the back of your
head that it's Sakurai that did those voices.

325
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,030
Hello, I'm the voice of Sanson, Horiuchi Kenyu.

326
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,420
Sanson has a dirty mouth and is a bit uncivilized.

327
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,250
He's a multi-dimensional character
that is actually very kind.

328
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,250
He told Marie that story.

329
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,970
He cleansed himself by
telling that story to help Marie.

330
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,930
Now, the Horiuchi Kenyu you see in
front of you might look innocent,

331
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:38,190
but I have both uncivilized and kind sides to
me that I want to let out, just like Sanson.

332
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,860
At first, I wondered how I
would develop his character.

333
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:49,160
After a year passed, because of the importance of
the story and the bond with the other voice actors

334
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,330
I feel like I was able to
make the best Sanson.

335
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:59,130
To all the fans out there! I hope you become
a strong yet gentle person like Sanson.

336
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,130
Good luck, everyone!

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,340
Hello there, I play Marie. I'm Mizutani Yuko.

338
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,760
Hm, talking about my own character.

339
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,730
I'm often told I'm very mature, so I wasn't sure
about playing such a small child like Marie.

340
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,730
But that's actually not true at all.

341
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm childish through and through.

342
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,240
When we first started, it was more of
a serious story with Nemo and Electra.

343
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,290
And in that serious story Marie just kind
of pops in and breaks all the tension.

344
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,290
When they went to South Island I was
worried she would break everyone.

345
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,630
It was kind of like,
"Oh, where did Marie go!"

346
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,140
I'm just saying, Anno really looks
like King when King's troubled.

347
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:03,560
Alrighty everyone! Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water
is getting a movie so please go and see it! Ok?

348
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,360
Excuse me.

349
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm the voice of Jean, Hidaka Noriko.

350
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,580
Jean's character, Jean himself is a very honest.

351
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,330
But, he always thinks about Nadia
and helps her continue on her path.

352
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:25,590
He really is a good boy by trying to get her to go back
home, but compared to how I would handle the situation

353
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,760
I don't know if I could act so cold to her.
If it were actually me, I'd get mad.

354
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,180
I'd say, "Do whatever you want, you're so selfish!"

355
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,980
I've received lots of letters from fans
saying they admire Jean's kindness.

356
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:48,990
When I get letters from girls saying they want
a boyfriend like Jean, it makes me happy.

357
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:56,660
Anno is a big bully. You see,
Jean uses a lot of technical terms.

358
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,080
Anno kept saying I don't have to nerd out,
but that I still have to pack his lines full of emotion.

359
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,880
He intentionally kept telling me contradicting
things and writing the reading of super simple kanji.

360
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,670
Just looking at my script,
it felt like I was being bullied.

361
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,630
To make matters worse, during the
soundtrack recording I had difficulty with

362
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,220
he had complicated kanji that
I couldn't read for the life of me

363
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,220
and he wouldn't answer any of my
questions and I had to best guess it all.

364
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,050
I hold a strong grudge.

365
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,230
I'm going to try my best to
deal with Nadia's selfishness.

366
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,520
I'm sure everyone has their
own issues, so good luck!

367
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,320
Hello, everyone. I'm the voice
of Nadia, Takamori Yoshino.

368
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,400
Hmm, what can I say.

369
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,240
Nadia, as I'm sure you all know

370
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,040
is selfish, stubborn, and has a horrible
sense for understanding others.

371
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,540
She has difficulty meshing
well with others in the group.

372
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,550
I guess I could say she's poor
at managing her weaknesses.

373
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:57,970
But, you know, I've come to find
those parts of her truly adorable.

374
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,100
I was really worried about how
to play Nadia in the beginning.

375
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,980
But I came to understand what kind of girl Nadia
was, and by then I was already having a blast.

376
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,740
Even though we have to wake up really early,
I look forward to work every single morning.

377
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:24,000
I first worked with Shimizu, the sound director,
during my first lead role in Alpen Rose.

378
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,500
I gained a lot of popularity from that and got to
work again with him for Sonic Soldier Borgman.

379
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,880
Finally, we met again for Nadia.

380
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,590
He is such a friendly person.

381
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:41,140
I take a lot of creative
liberties while in the studio.

382
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:50,520
While he has faith in me, sometimes
when we go drinking, he'll say

383
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,320
"Yoshino, I don't know about that part
you did today" as a way of warning me.

384
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm going to give it my all along with
Marie, Grandis, and the others.

385
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,000
Please cheer me on!

386
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,460
I'm the sound director Shimizu (Katsunori).

387
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,590
Probably, everyone's knowledge
about sound directors is fairly minimal.

388
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:26,560
It's a job that takes charge of all the
recording processes in the director's stead.

389
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,150
I have a lot of chances
to meet with the voice actors.

390
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,280
For this anime, for Nadia's cast,
we obviously had auditions.

391
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,740
For those auditions, we brought in all the
applicants and had them record right there.

392
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:52,670
Around 10 people, composed of musical and
agency producers also gathered to decide.

393
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,340
It was only 10 people, but everyone had their own
opinion about what was best, so it was still challenging.

394
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:07,600
For Nadia's cast, we ended up going with a lot of my
first choices, so it was easy to work with everyone.

395
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,610
Let's take a look at the other studio!

396
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,610
- Yeah!
- Ohhhh!

397
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,610
This studio is huge!

398
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,240
It really is!

399
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,360
This is the music recording studio.

400
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,870
It's where we recorded our
character songs and other music.

401
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,950
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

402
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,370
Oh, it's starting!

403
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,790
Ah, ah, ah. For the first...

404
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,830
Ah, ah. Too sharp?

405
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Ah, ah, ah.

406
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,800
Ok, let's start recording.

407
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,330
Hajimete no Koi by Noriko Hidaka & Yoshino Takamori

408
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,130
For the first time in my life

409
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,510
I've noticed these feelings

410
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:30,310
You're always there, deep in my heart

411
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:40,070
Even if I know your teasing is a joke

412
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:49,990
I can't smile back, my heart is fluttering

413
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,620
So lonely and so painful

414
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,550
It makes me want to run away

415
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,220
I ignore you even though I'm happy

416
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,140
When you look at me

417
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,350
Why is it so blinding? (You)

418
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,690
Why am I so thrilled? (My heart)

419
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,400
Is this love?

420
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:30,030
Even the stars spark
outside my window make me sigh

421
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,540
So, why do these tears (In my heart)

422
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,830
Spill down my cheeks? (Hot)

423
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,670
Is this love?

424
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:46,720
If I close my eyes, I can see you smiling

425
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:54,390
And you don't even know how I feel

426
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:11,410
After it rains, the
is so blue it wraps me up

427
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:20,330
The Sun's gentle rays melt my heart away

428
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:30,640
Every morning I en
running into you on this road

429
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:40,400
It makes me pretty happy

430
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,320
So lonely and so painful

431
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,780
I can't really tell you how I feel

432
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,450
All you have to say is "good morning"

433
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:01,130
And my heart starts racing

434
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,840
But these feelings (Right now)

435
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,170
Are a secret (Shhh)

436
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,930
Is this love?

437
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:20,600
I'm happy just kno
I'll see you again tomorrow

438
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,060
Oh, these feelings (Mine)

439
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,320
Are so precious (Forever)

440
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,110
Yes, this is love

441
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:37,160
I want to always be able to watch over you

442
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,750
So, one day I'll tell you

443
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,630
I love you

444
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,230
But these feelings (Right now)

445
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,650
Are a secret (Shhh)

446
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,370
Is this love?

447
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm happy just kno
I'll see you again tomorrow

448
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,590
Oh, these feelings (Mine)

449
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,750
Are so precious (Forever)

450
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,590
Yes, this is love

451
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:39,680
I want to always be able to watch over you

452
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,190
So, one day I'll tell you

453
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,940
I love you

454
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,660
Man, the pros know what they're doing.

455
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:06,250
Hearing it in the show is great and all, but
listening while they're recording is the best!

456
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,710
Hajimete no Koi was the first time for us to write
lyrics and for all three of us work together on lyrics.

457
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,130
Yeah that was hard work.

458
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,510
- It was!
Yeah that was hard work.

459
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,130
- It was!

460
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,340
- We were at that cafe...
-Really hard.

461
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,930
- That cafe...

462
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,840
How long were we working? Five hours?

463
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,430
- Five hours.
How long were we working? Five hours?

464
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,510
How long were we working? Five hours?

465
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,260
We were only able to get one
chorus done. One chorus, right?

466
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,470
We got about 1/3 of it finished.

467
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,270
- We got part way...
We got about 1/3 of it finished.

468
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,560
We got about 1/3 of it finished.

469
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,850
Making a song with three
people is surprisingly challenging.

470
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,350
- Yeah.
Making a song with three
people is surprisingly challenging.

471
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,770
Making a song with three
people is surprisingly challenging.

472
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,730
I thought by combining our power
we would work three times as fast.

473
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,610
- I thought the same.
I thought by combining our power
we would work three times as fast.

474
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,610
Too bad it wasn't like that.

475
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,820
No triple speed.

476
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,820
It felt like that.

477
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:44,200
Once we put it all together and sang,
it turned into a wonderful song.

478
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,790
I thought so too. What about you?

479
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,880
It's silly little song but it's
the most popular song.

480
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,380
No way?!

481
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,470
I mean, it's such a cute song. It has such a heartwarming message.

482
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,850
Right? Looking at it from
an adult's perspective...

483
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,930
It's embarrassing.

484
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,190
I intended to completely turn
into Nadia for that song.

485
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,190
Nadia...

486
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,860
- I wonder what everyone else thought about it.

487
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,690
- Turn into...
- I wonder what everyone else thought about it.

488
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,110
- I wonder what everyone else thought about it.

489
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:24,290
Umi Yorimo Yasashiku by Yoshino Takamori

490
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:44,060
You know, somet
when I'm alone I feel faint of heart

491
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:54,730
I call out to the father and mother I don't know

492
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:03,990
I'll tell someone my secret

493
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:17,970
When I'm lonely at night, I look for the stars

494
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:28,640
But, I'll be much, much more gentle than the sea

495
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:39,530
I won't cry now, I'll keep on walking

496
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:49,960
The truth is, I'm al
pretending to be strong

497
00:35:50,120 --> 00:36:00,130
As I hold on to this blue jewel at my chest

498
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:09,730
Someone please collect my tears

499
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:24,490
I'll search for love in all corners of the world

500
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:34,960
I'll become much, much bigger than the sea

501
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:46,010
I'll be sure to run far, far away

502
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:55,850
No matter how difficult

503
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:10,370
But, I'll be much, much more gentle than the sea.

504
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:20,960
I won't cry now, I'll keep on walking

505
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll become much, much bigger than the sea

506
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:42,990
I'll be sure to run far, far away

507
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,330
That was an amazing song.

508
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,580
It was. It was!

509
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,000
It would be great if she always acted like that.

510
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,330
Yeah! Yeah!

511
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,000
Ahem.

512
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:07,380
By the way, the production staff put so much effort
into creating Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water.

513
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,340
Let's ask them about their
thought on the episodes.

514
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,760
Yeah!

515
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,640
Good job, everyone.

516
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,890
You've honored us with a great service.

517
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,230
I'm Mori (Takeshi). I worked on the
storyboards and as an episode director.

518
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:29,320
At first, Nadia felt like it
was just a crazy passion project.

519
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,370
But before I knew it, I was
completely drawn into the world.

520
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,630
By the time I realize it, I was working
solo as the episode director.

521
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,550
Other people ran away one after another.

522
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,840
Unable to get my revenge, I did my best to
stay on as the episode director until the end.

523
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:56,350
I think Nadia is a great anime, and I hope
everyone continues to enjoy it for years to come.

524
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,270
I'm the character designer, Sadamoto (Yoshiyuki).

525
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:08,900
I intended, yet struggled, on how to make
well received, easy to understand characters.

526
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,740
I'm one of the animation directors, Suzuki.

527
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:23,670
Watching episode one, I don't think anyone
imagined it would turn into such a hard SF story.

528
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:35,430
During the production of the first episode, Anno was
taken with Miyazaki Hayao's Kiki's Delivery Service.

529
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,730
I remember the first episode's
storyboards changed a lot.

530
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,690
The first episode was a real shocker.

531
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,860
I'm one of the mechanical, animation,
and episode directors, Masuo (Soichi).

532
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,290
You could say, this anime
shows off Anno's true passion.

533
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:06,460
He let us do what we wanted to do.
He was incredibly hospitable to a lot of us.

534
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:15,350
Artistically, it feels less like
a TV series and more like an OVA.

535
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,810
I think you'll have fun when you watch it.

536
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,520
I'm Maeda (Mahiro), credited as the setting director.

537
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:29,730
I also worked on storyboarding and other
jobs here and there. I did whatever I could.

538
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,730
It feels weird to call it harmonious...

539
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,620
I guess, for better or worse we
had a lot of fun making Nadia.

540
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:42,040
There were parts I regretted
and parts I enjoyed.

541
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,590
Because of that, I have a lot of
memories associated with Nadia.

542
00:40:49,340 --> 00:41:02,770
I'll be happy if the parts I enjoyed while
in production translate to those watching.

543
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:10,730
When making Nadia, there was an
absolute rule we had to standby.

544
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,030
We couldn't lie to ourselves.
That was our one rule.

545
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,320
This was a show meant for children.

546
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,120
If we couldn't believe in ourselves,
how could they believe in us?

547
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,580
Additionally, there is always
another side to a situation.

548
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:31,000
This story features topics
like murder and war.

549
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,760
In respect to that, we don't talk negatively about
it, but we obviously don't talk positively about it.

550
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,100
We wanted to showcase all points of view.

551
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
All that's left is, well...

552
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:50,480
I started this project from the idea of wanting to
show the importance of people's encounters.

553
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,950
If the kids that watch this are glad they could
encounter an anime like this, I'd be overjoyed.

554
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,200
That's my wish.

555
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:08,670
What should I do a
this impatience in my heart

556
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,670
I've lost sight of my distant dream

557
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:18,510
I cry as I look up to the sky

558
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:26,100
Where our promise shines brightly

559
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:32,440
Try! Comforting words are like a breeze

560
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,740
That don't reach my heart

561
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:45,160
The anxieties I shoulder, grow

562
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,380
But I make my own decisions

563
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,590
So, I will probably be alright on my own

564
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:00,050
Even if I stumble, even if I get lost

565
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,430
There is always tomorrow
